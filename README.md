Email Processing
# Abstract:
Every one has an email account full of emails that be read or manage. We receive hundreds of emails daily and some of these emails are garbag or ads. Therefore, we want an application that is able to read all emails and manage them based on what we need from the email. So, the idea of this applcaition is to read all emails from the inbox and manange them. At the end, we will have only the emails that we want, on the other words plain text email that is readable by human and all other ads will not be read by the application.

## What is the system about?
Since we are dealing with big data, this project will make our life easy while reading emails from our inbox. Imagine that a person receives a hundred emails a day. Of course, he cannot read them all in one day. So, this system will read all the important emails for that person and then it will give the person what is the email about. Using data mining approaches the system will be able to do this boring work. Therefore, this system will only do three things:

- First read all emails from the Gmail inbox
- Second filter these emails by remove the ads and emails that contain link to website
- Thrid process the emails and then display the output
